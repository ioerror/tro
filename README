tro: Temporary Restraining OrShim

The tro package configures Tor as a JVM wide SOCKS proxy.
The system must run Tor on the standard 127.0.0.1:9050 or on a provided
address and port.

Warning: This is experimental software!

DNS leak warning:
It appears that the Oracle JVM leaks DNS for hostnames passed into certain
functions even though SOCKS5 is being used by the JVM. It is only safe to use
tro with a program that does not use hostnames at this time.
